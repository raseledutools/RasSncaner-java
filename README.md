# MakeACopy

MakeACopy is an open-source **offline document scanner with OCR** for Android, designed for privacy-friendly and self-hosted document workflows.

It allows you to digitize paper documents into **searchable PDFs** while
keeping the entire processing pipeline on your device. The app works
completely offline and avoids any cloud services, telemetry, or tracking.

MakeACopy is designed to be a **reliable building block for privacy-friendly
document workflows**, especially when combined with self-hosted storage
systems.

## Looking for a Microsoft Lens alternative?

With the discontinuation of Microsoft Lens, many users are looking for a reliable way to scan documents on Android.

MakeACopy offers the same core building blocks - document scanning, OCR, and searchable PDF export - while following a fundamentally different design:

- **Fully offline** – no cloud services required
- **No tracking or telemetry**
- **Open source and auditable**
- **Designed for long-term, self-hosted workflows**

Instead of integrating into a cloud ecosystem, MakeACopy focuses on local processing and interoperability with tools like SambaLite, paperless-ngx, and Syncthing.

This makes it especially suitable for users who prefer **control, privacy, and predictable behavior** over cloud-based convenience features.

## Mobile Document Pipeline

MakeACopy can be combined with
[SambaLite](https://github.com/egdels/SambaLite) to create a fully automated
mobile document workflow:

```
Paper document
      ↓
Scan with MakeACopy
      ↓
Inbox folder
      ↓
SambaLite folder sync
      ↓
NAS / archive (e.g. paperless-ngx)
```

This setup effectively turns your smartphone into a **privacy-friendly mobile
network scanner** for self-hosted document archives.

## Design Philosophy

MakeACopy treats privacy and offline operation as technical design decisions, not as moral or political statements.
The app works fully offline, is open source, and avoids tracking or cloud services because this results in a simpler, more robust, and more auditable system.
Users are encouraged to evaluate MakeACopy based on its concrete features and implementation rather than on positioning or narratives.

### App Size Note

To ensure fully offline operation, MakeACopy bundles OCR language models, fonts, and image processing components locally.
This significantly increases the app size, but avoids any cloud dependencies or on-demand downloads.

**100 MB are not a sign of excess, but of consistency.**

### Editions

MakeACopy is available in two editions:

| Edition | OCR Languages | Fonts | APK Size (arm64-v8a) |
|---------|--------------|-------|---------------------|
| **Full** | 22 languages (incl. CJK, Arabic, Thai, Turkish) | 4 fonts (incl. CJK) | ~99 MB |
| **Light** | English + German | 1 font (NotoSans) | ~58 MB |

Both editions include the same ML-based document detection (ONNX model), OpenCV image processing, and full offline functionality. Both editions use an operator-stripped ONNX Runtime build that includes only the operators required for document detection. The Light edition additionally ships fewer OCR language models, fonts, and dictionaries, and uses a minimal ONNX Runtime AAR without XNNPACK and NNAPI to further reduce APK size.

The Full edition is available on F-Droid and Google Play. The Light edition is available exclusively via [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/egdels/makeacopy/releases).

## Installation

### F-Droid

MakeACopy is F-Droid compliant. The app builds all required native components from source during CI/local builds:

1. **OpenCV Java Classes**: The required OpenCV Java wrapper classes are directly included in the app's source tree (copied from OpenCV but now part of this project). They are no longer used from the submodule.
2. **OpenCV Native Libraries**: All OpenCV native libraries are built from source using the official OpenCV code provided via the Git submodule at `external/opencv`.
3. **ONNX Runtime Native Libraries**: For ML-assisted edge detection, ONNX Runtime is built from source (XNNPACK and NNAPI, Java bindings) using the submodule at `external/onnxruntime` via `scripts/build_onnxruntime_android.sh`. The resulting artifacts are integrated into `app/src/main/jniLibs/<ABI>/` (e.g., `libonnxruntime.so`, `libonnxruntime4j_jni.so`) and `app/libs/` (`onnxruntime-*.jar`).

This approach ensures F-Droid compatibility by not including any pre-compiled binaries in the repository and building OpenCV and ONNX Runtime native components from source.

### GitHub Releases

You can download the latest APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/egdels/makeacopy/releases) page.

#### Automated Builds

All automated builds are handled by a single GitHub Actions workflow:

- Workflow: [.github/workflows/build-release.yml](.github/workflows/build-release.yml)
- Triggers: on push to main, pull_request to main, and tags starting with v*

The workflow contains two parallel jobs:

**Full build** (`build`):
- Sets up JDK 21 (Temurin) and installs Android NDK 28.0.13004108
- Pins CMake 3.31.6 and Python 3.11.2 for deterministic native builds
- Checks out submodules (external/opencv and external/onnxruntime)
- Builds OpenCV native libraries from source via scripts/build_opencv_android.sh
- Collects reproducibility evidence for native builds (scripts/collect_repro_evidence.sh)
- Integrates OpenCV artifacts into the app via scripts/prepare_opencv.sh
- Builds ONNX Runtime for Android (XNNPACK and NNAPI, Java bindings) via scripts/build_onnxruntime_android.sh
- Builds the Full edition Android app with Gradle (AAB and ABI-split APKs)

**Light build** (`build-light`):
- Depends on the Full build job and downloads the native libraries (jniLibs and JARs) built from source
- Sets up JDK 21 only (no native build scripts needed)
- Builds the Light edition: `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease -Pedition=light`
- Produces per-ABI APKs named `MakeACopy-Light-vX.Y.Z-<abi>-release.apk`

Behavior by event type:
- Push/PR to main (non-tag):
  - Builds unsigned artifacts (Full: Release AAB and per-ABI Release APKs; Light: per-ABI Release APKs)
  - Uploads all artifacts for download from the workflow run
- Tag (refs/tags/vX.Y.Z):
  - Optionally decodes a keystore from repository secrets and signs the builds
  - Verifies APK signatures using apksigner
  - Renames artifacts to MakeACopy-vX.Y.Z-<abi>-release.apk, MakeACopy-Light-vX.Y.Z-<abi>-release.apk, and MakeACopy-vX.Y.Z-release.aab
  - Generates SHA-256 checksum files for each artifact
  - Loads release notes from fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/changelogs/<versionCode>.txt
  - Creates a GitHub Release and attaches all Full and Light APKs, the AAB, and their .sha256 files
  - Uploads artifacts to the workflow as well

How to trigger a release build:
1. Create a tag starting with v (e.g., v1.0.0)
2. Push the tag to GitHub
3. The workflow will build native libraries (OpenCV, ONNX Runtime) from source, build the app, sign (if secrets provided), verify, checksum, and publish a GitHub Release with artifacts

Notes:
- All native components are built from source to stay F-Droid compatible; no prebuilt binaries are stored in the repo.
- Both editions use an operator-stripped ONNX Runtime build. The Full edition includes XNNPACK and NNAPI support and is built via `scripts/build_onnxruntime_android.sh`. The Light edition reuses the OpenCV native libraries from the Full build and builds a minimal ONNX Runtime AAR (without XNNPACK/NNAPI) from source via `scripts/build_minimal_onnxruntime.sh`, further reducing APK size.
- The edition is controlled via the Gradle property `edition` (default: `full`). F-Droid builds use the default and require no special configuration.
- A look at [.github/workflows/build-release.yml](.github/workflows/build-release.yml) shows you how the build process works and how you can reproduce it in your own development environment.

#### Building the Light Edition

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease -Pedition=light -PenableAbiSplits=true
```

The Light edition uses `applicationIdSuffix ".light"` (`de.schliweb.makeacopy.light`) and includes only English and German OCR models, the NotoSans-Regular font, and English/German dictionaries.

## Architecture

MakeACopy follows the Single-Activity + Multi-Fragment pattern with MVVM architecture.

- **Camera Fragment**: Capture via CameraX/Camera2
- **Crop Fragment**: Perspective correction
- **OCR Fragment**: Tesseract-based recognition
- **Export Fragment**: PDF/text export

### OCR Dictionaries

MakeACopy uses word frequency dictionaries for OCR post-processing to improve text recognition accuracy.

**Source:** [FrequencyWords by Hermit Dave](https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords)  
**License:** [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)  
**Data Origin:** Wikipedia word frequency lists

The dictionaries are used to validate and correct OCR results by checking recognized words against known word lists. This helps reduce common OCR errors while maintaining fully offline operation.

Included dictionaries cover 22 languages: Arabic (ara), Czech (ces), Danish (dan), German (deu), English (eng), Persian (fas), French (fra), Hungarian (hun), Italian (ita), Dutch (nld), Norwegian (nor), Polish (pol), Portuguese (por), Romanian (ron), Russian (rus), Slovak (slk), Spanish (spa), Swedish (swe), Thai (tha), Turkish (tur), Chinese Simplified (chi_sim), and Chinese Traditional (chi_tra).

## Submodules

- external/opencv — OpenCV source used to build native libraries during the build; Apache 2.0.
- external/onnxruntime — ONNX Runtime source required for ML-assisted corner detection; MIT License.
  - Built from source via scripts/build_onnxruntime_android.sh (XNNPACK and NNAPI, Java bindings).
  - Artifacts integrated into app/src/main/jniLibs/<ABI>/ (libonnxruntime.so, libonnxruntime4j_jni.so) and app/libs/ (onnxruntime-*.jar).
  - See [NOTICE](NOTICE) for attributions.

### Optional OCR Language-Packs

MakeACopy includes fast, compact Tesseract models by default.  
If you want **higher accuracy OCR**, you can install optional *Language-Pack APKs*:

- **MakeACopy OCR Latin (Best)** → Includes best-quality models for  
  English (eng), German (deu), French (fra), Italian (ita), Spanish (spa), Portuguese (por), Dutch (nld), Polish (pol), Czech (ces), Slovak (slk), Hungarian (hun), Romanian (ron), Danish (dan), Norwegian (nor), Swedish (swe).

How it works:
- Language-Packs are separate, permissionless APKs.
- They only contain `.traineddata` files, no code, no network.
- MakeACopy discovers installed packs locally and lets you import the models.
- Once imported, the best models appear in the OCR language selection.

📦 [GitHub Release Page](https://github.com/egdels/makeacopy/releases/tag/langpack-latin-best-v1.1.0)

Notes:
- Packs are signed with the same key as the main app, so you can verify them with `apksigner`.
- They rarely change (only when new Tesseract models are published).

Alternatively: You can also use the original Tesseract "best" models from the official tessdata repository.
- Source: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata_best
- Tesseract project: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract  
  Install or download the desired `.traineddata` files and add them via the same import dialog in MakeACopy.

### 📝 Notes from the Field

- A public review claimed that *MakeACopy* installs other apps and drains the battery.  
  This is technically impossible, as the app only requests the `CAMERA` permission.  
  This highlights how misunderstandings can sometimes appear in public reviews.

- An anonymous email criticized the application size without providing actionable feedback.  
  While not directly addressable, it serves as a reminder that open-source projects may also receive non-constructive input.
