/**
 * AppDatabase is the main database class for the application. It serves as a primary access point
 * to the defined Room Database. This database includes several entities and their relationships,
 * allowing data persistence for scans, collections, and their associations.
 *
 * <p>The database supports the following entities: - ScanEntity: Represents a completed scan in the
 * local index. - CollectionEntity: Represents a collection, which can group multiple scans. -
 * ScanCollectionCrossRef: Represents the many-to-many relationship between scans and collections.
 *
 * <p>It defines three DAOs (Data Access Objects) for interacting with the database: - ScansDao:
 * Provides CRUD operations and queries for ScanEntity. - CollectionsDao: Provides CRUD operations
 * and queries for CollectionEntity. - ScanCollectionJoinDao: Provides operations for managing
 * relationships between scans and collections.
 *
 * <p>The database is implemented as a singleton to ensure a single instance is used across the
 * application. It also allows fallback to destructive migration, suitable for prototyping or
 * initial development.
