/**
 * Represents metadata for a scanned index. This class encapsulates essential details about a scan,
 * such as its identifier, title, creation time, number of pages, and optional additional metadata.
 *
 * <p>Instances of this class are typically associated with scanned documents and their metadata as
 * stored or processed by the application.
 *
 * <p>Fields: - id: A unique, stable identifier for the scan. If not provided during instantiation,
 * a new UUID is generated. - title: The human-readable title of the scan. - createdAt: The
 * timestamp in milliseconds since the epoch when the scan was created. - pageCount: The total
 * number of pages in the scan. - coverPath: An optional path or URI to the cover image or thumbnail
 * of the scan. - exportPathsJson: An optional JSON-encoded string containing paths to the exported
 * files. - sourceMetaJson: An optional JSON-encoded string containing the source metadata.
 *
 * <p>This class serves as a lightweight data holder that might be used in conjunction with other
 * application components (e.g., data transfer, entities, or processing tools).
 *
 * @param id stable ID; if null provided, a new UUID will be generated
