/**
 * Represents a many-to-many relationship between scans and collections in the database.
 *
 * <p>This class is used as a join entity in the Room persistence library to associate ScanEntity
 * and CollectionEntity objects. Each association has a primary composite key consisting of a scan
 * ID and a collection ID, and it also tracks the timestamp when the association was created.
 *
 * <p>Annotations: - @Entity: Defines this class as a Room entity for the "scan_collection_join"
 * table. - @PrimaryKey: Specifies "scanId" and "collectionId" as the composite primary key.
 * - @Index: Defines an index on the "collectionId" column to improve query performance.
 *
 * <p>Fields: - scanId: The unique identifier of the ScanEntity associated with this relationship. -
 * collectionId: The unique identifier of the CollectionEntity associated with this relationship. -
 * addedAt: The epoch timestamp when this scan was added to the collection.
 *
 * <p>Constructor: - Initializes the instance with the specified scan ID, collection ID, and added
 * timestamp.
